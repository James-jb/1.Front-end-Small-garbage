<h1>The wheel of history</h1>

The wheel of history is not only something that we observe and analyze, but also something that we influence and shape. We are not passive spectators or victims of the wheel of history, but active participants and agents of the wheel of history. We can learn from the past, act in the present and envision the future. We can challenge the assumptions, question the narratives and change the direction of the wheel of history.


So this is a very random library that writes some weird things.
